## 📖 Introduction
Driving on hilly roads is risky due to **narrow paths, sharp curves, blind spots, and poor visibility**.  
Traditional safety measures such as mirrors or signs often fail to provide **real-time alerts**.  
This project proposes a **low-cost, IoT-enabled accident prevention system** to **enhance road safety** by detecting nearby obstacles and warning drivers instantly through **LED indicators**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Detect obstacles and vehicles** in real-time using ultrasonic sensors.  
- **Provide instant visual alerts** using LEDs to warn drivers of potential hazards.  
- **Reduce collisions and improve reaction time** in accident-prone hilly regions.  
- **Ensure a portable, low-cost solution** suitable for remote and underdeveloped areas.  
- Create a **scalable system** that can integrate with advanced IoT features in the future.
